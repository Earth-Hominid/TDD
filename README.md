# Test Driven Development

This project is dedicated to practicising TDD. Jest is utilzed for the automated tests. This project is part of **The Odin Project Full Stack [Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/testing-basics)**

## Description

The concept of TDD is extremely important in modern programming. This repository holds problems, solutions and tests I wrote to practise the TDD skill set. 

Individual unit tests are designed utilizing Jest. 

Programs are designed using design recipes from UBC's  Systematic Program Design [course](https://edge.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBC+CPSC110+2017S/77860a93562d40bda45e452ea064998b/). 

Function design is composed of five steps:
1. Write the signature, purpose and stub.
2. Define examples, wrap each in check-expect
3. Template and inventory
4. Code the function body
5. Test and debug until correct

Data design is composed of the following steps:
1. A possible structure definition (not until compound data)
2. A type comment that defines type name and describes how to form data
3. An interpretation to describe correspondence between information and data.
4. One or more examples of the data.
5. A template for one argument function operating on data of this type.
